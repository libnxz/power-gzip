   This function allocates the 'children' global array of size n containing the
   pid of each child process created. The function guarantees processes call
   deflateInit in order, so children[0] will have called deflateInit first, and
   children[n-1] last.

   The user can control the deflate job performed by each child by implementing
   a child_do function, that will be called by each child between deflateInit
   and deflateEnd.

   After function return, all children will have called deflateInit
   and will remain in a blocked state until SIGUSR1 is sent to them, indicating
   they should resume execution by calling child_do and deflateEnd right after.
